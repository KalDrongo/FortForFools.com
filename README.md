# FortForFools.com
A website that was initially intended just for storing my own personal things I've learned in an easily archive-able and searchable format. But it can be used to store information and pictures on just about anything.
If you want to use it all you have to do is add these files to a web server and make an empty uploads folder for the images to go into that are put on the site.
Also you have to build the database from the FfF_DML and edit the db_connection file in includes to point
to wherever you put your new database.
